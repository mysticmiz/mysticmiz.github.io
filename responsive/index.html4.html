10 Essential Anita Rachvelishvili Clips to Enjoy (At Home)

Anita Rachvelishvili must be one of the most exciting artists performing in opera today. So, in honor of her appearance on the cover of OPERA NEWS's September issue, we're sharing our ten essential clips of the great Georgian mezzo in performance.

Anita Rachvelishvili as Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana at Dutch National Opera

 

10. Rachvelishvili’s no-holds-barred rendition of Piazzolla’s “Yo soy Maria” goes to the edge of camp without crossing the line. “Are you ready, guys?” —LTG 

 

9. Rachvelishvili sings an orchestral arrangement of “Caruso,” singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla’s popular Italian ballad. —FPD 

 

8. The mezzo brings a surprising idiomatic ease and sultry melismas to this torchy rendition of “Summertime.” —AW 

 

7. Here’s another jazz standard that shows off Rachvelishvili’s remarkable versatility: eden ahbez’s “Nature Boy” gets a performance that wouldn’t sound out of place in a West Village club, let alone a Georgian morning talkshow. —AW 

 

6. In this clip from the National Opera House in her native Tbilisi, Georgia, opposite tenor George Oniani, Rachvelishvili offers her typically impassioned interpretation of Amneris as a “young girl who is crazy in love with this beautiful man.” —LTG 

 

5. Rachvelishvili treats Dalila’s “Mon coeur” with a hushed, gorgeous delicacy on her Sony solo debut disc. —HS 

 

4. Rachvelishvili is audibly and visually haunted by the events she recounts in Trovatore’s “Stride la vampa” at the Met. —HS 

 

 

3. For Paris’s Bastille Day, Rachvelishvili sings a stunning “Ô ma lyre immortelle” from Gounod’s Sapho—an aria that also appears on her 2018 self-titled album. —EG 

 

2. The mezzo sings Santuzza’s “Easter Hymn” from Cavalleria Rusticana with the Dutch National Opera. —FPD 

 

1. The Georgian mezzo’s favorite video of her own work—in fact, the only one she can bear to listen to—is the Dmitri Tcherniakov production of The Tsar’s Bride. In this intensely engaged performance, you can see why. —LTG

In Review Davidsen thmb 920
Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen, singing in the latest installment of Met Stars Live in Concert, might invite comparisons to, say, a volcano, but those erupt—they spit and struggle—whereas Davidsen simply opens, and magmatic music comes out as effortlessly as healthy breaths.

In Review Marina Abramovic thmb 2 920
Maria Callas famously immersed herself in each moment of each role she sang. In the Bavarian State Opera's world-premiere presentation of 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, Marina Abramović chooses to immerse herself in herself.
